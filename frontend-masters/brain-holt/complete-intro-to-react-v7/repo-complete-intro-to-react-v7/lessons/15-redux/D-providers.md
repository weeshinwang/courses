Okay, let's go integrate this now where context was being used before. Go to App.js:

```javascript
// delete ThemeContext, useState import

// import
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import store from "./store";

// delete useState call
// delete ThemeContext

// wrap app with
<Provider store={store}>[â€¦]</Provider>;
```

Feels nice deleting a lot of code, right?

Just like context makes your store available anywhere in your app, so does Provider.

Now that Redux is available everywhere, let's go add it to SearchParams.js

```javascript
// replace ThemeContext import
// delete useContext import
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";

// replace context and some usestate references
const animal = useSelector((state) => state.animal);
const location = useSelector((state) => state.location);
const breed = useSelector((state) => state.breed);
const theme = useSelector((state) => state.theme);
```

- This is the newer, hooks-based API for react-redux. This allows you to provide it a selector function that will pluck the bit of state you need from Redux. Very clean, I quite like it. We'll see the older, connect-based one here in a bit.
- You may wonder why we don't just do one `useSelector` call here, return the whole state, and destructure that. Each hook is creating its own subscription and `react-redux` internally uses the functions you provide to check to see if your subscription changed. If the result of your selector function changes, it'll notify React to kick off a re-render of this component. Hence it's important that these subscription functions _just_ grab the state that you care about. Otherwise it will kick off needless re-renders any time _any_ state in your app changes.
