description: "Visual Studio Code has an amazing VS Code extension to use with Jest made by a former TypeScript developer. It makes working Jest a wonderful experience."
---

[Please go install this extension][jest-vscode].

This extension makes working with Jest magical âœ¨

Some highlights:

- Every time you save a file your test suite will run so you can failures faster. (this is configurable if your tests take a long time to run.)
- A nice little visual indicator on the tests themselves that they past their last run.
- The ability to debug individual tests.
- Inline you can see test failures. You can see which test is failing and why.
- A nice test explore pane on the sidebar.
- You can update Jest snapshots directly from a prompt in VS Code.
- You can see Jest snapshots directly from the test code without having to navigate to them.

I'm a big fan. Now every time I work with Jest I use it. Highly suggest installing it anytime you're near Jest.
